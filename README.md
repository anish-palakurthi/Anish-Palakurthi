Hey! My name is Anish. I'm studying Computer Science and Math at UT.

I've done work in:
- Compilers
- On-chip DRL-based energy and performance optimizations
- BCI
- Synthetic data generation

I'm always learning more, but I am most familiar with:
- Rust
- Python 
- Java/TypeScript
- C

Right now, I am working at BoundaryML, building a Rust-based configuration language to get the most out of LLMs in production.

Check out my open-source contributions in the BAML repo below!

Thanks for reading!
