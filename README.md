Hey! My name is Anish. I'm studying Computer Science at UT.

I built a super fast search indexer called `supersearch` to see if I could put performance engineering theory into practice. 

At Boundary, I contributed to the core compiler for `BAML`, a programming language for designing agent flows, using entirely Rust.

Currently, I do research at UT's Learning-Directed Operating System's lab, working on `KernMLOps`, a framework for training and deploying ML into kernels.

In my free time, I work on using RL within tightly bottlenecked environments. I built `DeepScale` to do this and manage CPU clock speeds proactively.

Check out my repos below! Would love feedback.
